1. Contextualization of the research project in Brazil

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 777 million cases and 7.05 million deaths have been reported globally, despite vaccination efforts (WHO, 2025). Variants of concern (VOCs) such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron have shown increased transmissibility and immune evasion compared to the original Wuhan strain (DE SOUZA, Anacleto S. et al., 2022; GISAID, 2025). As of January 2025, Omicron subvariants accounted for nearly 100% of global cases, with XEC (47%) and KP.3.1.1 (23%) being predominant, with varying distributions across regions such as Brazil and Europe  (GISAID, 2025). At the molecular level, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the release and translation of viral RNA into polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed by the PLpro and 3CLpro (Mpro) proteases, with Mpro being essential for viral replication (AMORIM, V. M. de F. et al., 2024). Its active form is a homodimer, in which each protomer consists of three domains, known as domains I, II, and III. Our previous study suggests that His41-Cys145-Asp187 compose the catalytic triad of Mpro, being essential for the catalytic process (AMORIM, V. M. de F. et al., 2024). Due to this structure, over 55,429 compounds have been tested against Mpro (more details in results). However, few have advanced to clinical trials. For example, Boceprevir demonstrated promising affinity but faces pharmacokinetic (PK) limitations, such as CYP3A4 inhibition. To address these challenges, combinations like Nirmatrelvir and Ritonavir (Paxlovid) have been developed to optimize therapeutic efficacy. 
Herein, we investigated the interplay between PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties using machine learning (ML) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We developed classification models employing algorithms such as Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Classification and Regression Trees, and Multilayer Perceptrons. These models, trained on IC50 data from FRET assays, fluorescence assays, and mixed datasets (FRET, fluorescence, and SPR assays), achieved accuracies ranging from 0.72 to 0.96, with external validation accuracies of 0.75 to 0.83 on chemically diverse datasets. Our analysis revealed that inhibitors with high pIC50 values (-log pIC50) are associated with hydrophilic features that enhance Mpro binding but compromise PK properties, while hydrophobic residues are critical for stabilizing interactions in the S2 subsite, as confirmed by MD simulations. These findings highlight the importance of targeting the S2 subsite to balance PD and PK properties and provide a computational framework for the rational design of Mpro inhibitors, offering a pathway for preclinical optimization of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

2. General and specific objectives

2.1. General objective 

The primary goal of this study was to develop an integrated computational framework combining ligand- and structure-based drug design approaches to discover and optimize potent SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. This involved systematic data preprocessing, machine learning (ML) modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to enhance the prediction and understanding of inhibitor binding mechanisms. This pipeline will be fundamental in high-throughput virtual screening due to its high computational scalability of the ZINC database.

2.2. Specific objectives

Dataset Construction and Preprocessing. (1) Curate and clean a large dataset of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors from published data; (2) Transform IC50 values into pIC50 and refine binding constant estimates (Ki, KD, KM) by accounting for experimental conditions; (3) Develop computational methods for handling missing, censored, or ambiguous inhibition data.

Computational feature engineering. (1) Calculate 2D and 3D molecular descriptors using parallelized functions for efficiency; (2) Apply dimensionality reduction, correlation filtering, and imputation techniques to optimize feature selection and prevent overfitting.

Data visualization and dimensionality reduction. (1) Utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for decreasing high-dimensional molecular descriptor data and investigate chemical relationships with biological activity; (2) Use statistical inference in order to build confidence intervals and interpret dataset; (3) Use of histogram, boxplot, among other, further tables to extract data information.

Molecular docking and dynamics simulations. (1) Perform molecular docking to predict inhibitor binding poses and binding affinity; (2) Conduct MD simulations to evaluate protein-ligand stability, binding free energy (free-energy landscape), and dynamic interactions over 150 ns.

Statistical and chemoinformatics analysis. (1) Interpret ML decision rules to identify key molecular descriptors influencing inhibitory activity; (2) Compute confidence intervals for statistically significant subpopulations of inhibitors.
